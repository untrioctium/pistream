# pistream
Personal MP3 streaming site designed for Raspberry Pi.

Add a symlink in ./stream/static named music to whatever folder contains your MP3s. Run scan to add MP3s. Add a valid Last.fm API key and secret in lastfm.py to enable Last.fm connectivity for scrobbling and media info download. I'll need to note what version of Django and what libraries are needed later.
